Thou art thy mother's glass thee Calls back lovely April prime, thou windows thine age shalt see, Despite wrinkles thy golden time. thou live remembered be, Die single thine image dies thee. 4 Unthrifty loveliness dost thou spend, Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy? Nature's bequest gives nothing doth lend, frank lends free: beauteous niggard dost thou abuse, bounteous largess given thee give? Profitless usurer dost thou use great sum sums yet canst live? traffic thy self alone, Thou thy self thy sweet self dost deceive, nature calls thee gone, acceptable audit canst thou leave? Thy unused beauty must tombed thee, used lives th' executor be. 5 hours gentle work frame lovely gaze every eye doth dwell Will play tyrants same, unfair fairly doth excel: never-resting time leads summer hideous winter confounds there, Sap checked frost lusty leaves quite gone, Beauty o'er-snowed bareness every where: summer's distillation left liquid prisoner pent walls glass, Beauty's effect beauty bereft, remembrance was. flowers distilled though winter meet, Leese show, substance still lives sweet. 6 let winter's ragged hand deface, thee thy summer ere thou distilled: Make sweet vial; treasure thou place, beauty's treasure ere self-killed: use forbidden usury, happies pay willing loan; thy self breed another thee, ten times happier ten one, Ten times thy self happier thou art, ten thine ten times refigured thee: death thou shouldst depart, Leaving thee living posterity? self-willed thou art much fair, death's conquest make worms thine heir. 7 Lo orient gracious light Lifts burning head, eye Doth homage new-appearing sight, Serving looks sacred majesty, climbed steep-up heavenly hill, Resembling strong youth middle age, Yet mortal looks adore beauty still, Attending golden pilgrimage: highmost pitch weary car, Like feeble age reeleth day, eyes (fore duteous) now converted low tract look another way: thou, thy self out-going thy noon: Unlooked diest unless thou get son. 8 Music hear, hear'st thou music sadly? Sweets sweets war not, joy delights joy: lov'st thou thou receiv'st gladly, else receiv'st pleasure thine annoy? true concord well-tuned sounds, unions married offend thine ear, sweetly chide thee, confounds singleness parts thou shouldst bear: Mark one string sweet husband another, Strikes mutual ordering; Resembling sire, child, happy mother, one, one pleasing note sing: Whose speechless song many, seeming one, Sings thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'. 9 fear wet widow's eye, thou consum'st thy self single life? Ah, thou issueless shalt hap die, world will wail thee like makeless wife, world will thy widow still weep, thou form thee hast left behind, every private widow well may keep, children's eyes, husband's shape mind: Look unthrift world doth spend Shifts place, still world enjoys it; beauty's waste hath world end, kept unused user destroys it: love toward others bosom sits murd'rous shame commits. 10 shame deny thou bear'st love thy self art unprovident. Grant thou wilt, thou art beloved many, thou none lov'st evident: thou art possessed murd'rous hate, 'gainst thy self thou stick'st conspire, Seeking beauteous roof ruinate repair thy chief desire: O change thy thought, may change mind, Shall hate fairer lodged gentle love? thy presence gracious kind, thy self least kind-hearted prove, Make thee another self love me, beauty still may live thine thee. 11 fast thou shalt wane fast thou grow'st, one thine, thou departest, fresh blood youngly thou bestow'st, Thou mayst call thine, thou youth convertest, Herein lives wisdom, beauty, increase, Without folly, age, cold decay, minded so, times cease, threescore year make world away: Let nature hath made store, Harsh, featureless, rude, barrenly perish: Look best endowed, gave thee more; bounteous gift thou shouldst bounty cherish: carved thee seal, meant thereby, Thou shouldst print more, let copy die. 12 count clock tells time, see brave day sunk hideous night, behold violet past prime, sable curls silvered o'er white: lofty trees see barren leaves, erst heat canopy herd summer's green girded sheaves Borne bier white bristly beard: thy beauty question make thou among wastes time must go, Since sweets beauties forsake, die fast see others grow, nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence Save breed brave him, takes thee hence. 13 O self, love longer yours, self live, coming end prepare, sweet semblance give. beauty hold lease Find determination, self self's decease, sweet issue sweet form bear. lets fair house fall decay, husbandry honour might uphold, stormy gusts winter's day barren rage death's eternal cold? O none unthrifts, dear love know, father, let son say so. 14 stars judgement pluck, yet methinks astronomy, tell good, evil luck, plagues, dearths, seasons' quality, can fortune brief minutes tell; Pointing thunder, rain wind, say princes shall go well oft predict heaven find. thine eyes knowledge derive, constant stars read art truth beauty shall together thrive thy self, store thou wouldst convert: else thee prognosticate, Thy end truth's beauty's doom date. 15 consider every thing grows Holds perfection little moment. huge stage presenteth nought shows Whereon stars secret influence comment. perceive men plants increase, Cheered checked even self-same sky: Vaunt youthful sap, height decrease, wear brave state memory. conceit inconstant stay, Sets rich youth sight, wasteful time debateth decay change day youth sullied night, war Time love you, takes you, engraft new. 16 wherefore mightier way Make war upon bloody tyrant Time? fortify self decay means blessed barren rhyme? Now stand top happy hours, many maiden gardens yet unset, virtuous wish bear living flowers, Much liker painted counterfeit: lines life life repair (Time's pencil) pupil pen Neither inward worth outward fair Can make live self eyes men. give away self, keeps self still, must live drawn sweet skill. 17 will believe verse time come filled high deserts? Though yet heaven knows tomb hides life, shows half parts: write beauty eyes, fresh numbers number graces, age come say poet lies, heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces. papers (yellowed age) scorned, like old men less truth tongue, true rights termed poet's rage, stretched metre antique song. child yours alive time, live twice it, rhyme. 18 Shall compare thee summer's day? Thou art lovely temperate: Rough winds shake darling buds May, summer's lease hath short date: Sometime hot eye heaven shines, often gold complexion dimmed, every fair fair sometime declines, chance, nature's changing course untrimmed: thy eternal summer shall fade, lose possession fair thou ow'st, shall death brag thou wand'rest shade, eternal lines time thou grow'st, long men can breathe eyes can see, long lives this, gives life thee. 19 Devouring Time blunt thou lion's paws, make earth devour sweet brood, Pluck keen teeth fierce tiger's jaws, burn long-lived phoenix, blood, Make glad sorry seasons thou fleet'st, whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time wide world fading sweets: forbid thee one heinous crime, O carve thy hours love's fair brow, draw lines thine antique pen, thy course untainted allow, beauty's pattern succeeding men. Yet thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong, love shall verse ever live young. 20 woman's face nature's hand painted, Hast thou master mistress passion, woman's gentle heart acquainted shifting change false women's fashion, eye bright theirs, less false rolling: Gilding object whereupon gazeth, man hue hues controlling, steals men's eyes women's souls amazeth. woman wert thou first created, Till nature wrought thee fell a-doting, addition thee defeated, adding one thing purpose nothing. since pricked thee women's pleasure, Mine thy love thy love's use treasure. 21 muse, Stirred painted beauty verse, heaven self ornament doth use, every fair fair doth rehearse, Making couplement proud compare sun moon, earth sea's rich gems: April's first-born flowers things rare, heaven's air huge rondure hems. O let true love truly write, believe me, love fair, mother's child, though bright gold candles fixed heaven's air: Let say like hearsay well, will praise purpose sell. 22 glass shall persuade old, long youth thou one date, thee time's furrows behold, look death days expiate. beauty doth cover thee, seemly raiment heart, thy breast doth live, thine me, can elder thou art? O therefore love thyself wary, self, thee will, Bearing thy heart will keep chary tender nurse babe faring ill. Presume thy heart mine slain, Thou gav'st thine give back again. 23 unperfect actor stage, fear put beside part, fierce thing replete much rage, Whose strength's abundance weakens heart; fear trust, forget say, perfect ceremony love's rite, mine love's strength seem decay, O'ercharged burthen mine love's might: O let looks eloquence, dumb presagers speaking breast, plead love, look recompense, tongue hath expressed. O learn read silent love hath writ, hear eyes belongs love's fine wit. 24 Mine eye hath played painter hath stelled, Thy beauty's form table heart, body frame wherein 'tis held, perspective best painter's art. painter must see skill, find true image pictured lies, bosom's shop hanging still, hath windows glazed thine eyes: Now see good turns eyes eyes done, Mine eyes drawn thy shape, thine windows breast, where-through sun Delights peep, gaze therein thee; Yet eyes cunning want grace art, draw see, know heart. 25 Let favour stars, public honour proud titles boast, Whilst fortune triumph bars Unlooked joy honour most; Great princes' favourites fair leaves spread, marigold sun's eye, pride lies buried, frown glory die. painful warrior famoused fight, thousand victories foiled, book honour razed quite, rest forgot toiled: happy love beloved may remove removed. 26 Lord love, vassalage Thy merit hath duty strongly knit; thee send written embassage witness duty, show wit. Duty great, wit poor mine May make seem bare, wanting words show it; hope good conceit thine thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it: Till whatsoever star guides moving, Points graciously fair aspect, puts apparel tattered loving, show worthy thy sweet respect, may dare boast love thee, Till then, show head thou mayst prove me. 27 Weary toil, haste bed, dear respose limbs travel tired, begins journey head work mind, body's work's expired. thoughts (from far abide) Intend zealous pilgrimage thee, keep drooping eyelids open wide, Looking darkness blind see. Save soul's imaginary sight Presents thy shadow sightless view, like jewel (hung ghastly night) Makes black night beauteous, old face new. Lo thus day limbs, night mind, thee, self, quiet find. 28 can return happy plight debarred benefit rest? day's oppression eased night, day night night day oppressed. (though enemies either's reign) consent shake hands torture me, one toil, complain far toil, still farther thee. tell day please thou art bright, dost grace clouds blot heaven: flatter swart-complexioned night, sparkling stars twire thou gild'st even. day doth daily draw sorrows longer, night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger 29 disgrace Fortune men's eyes, alone beweep outcast state, trouble deaf heaven bootless cries, look upon self curse fate, Wishing like one rich hope, Featured like him, like friends possessed, Desiring man's art, man's scope, enjoy contented least, Yet thoughts self almost despising, Haply think thee, state, (Like lark break day arising sullen earth) sings hymns heaven's gate, thy sweet love remembered wealth brings, scorn change state kings. 30 sessions sweet silent thought, summon remembrance things past, sigh lack many thing sought, old woes new wail dear time's waste: can drown eye (unused flow) precious friends hid death's dateless night, weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe, moan th' expense many vanished sight. can grieve grievances foregone, heavily woe woe tell o'er sad account fore-bemoaned moan, new pay paid before. think thee (dear friend) losses restored, sorrows end. 31 Thy bosom endeared hearts, lacking supposed dead, reigns love love's loving parts, friends thought buried. many holy obsequious tear Hath dear religious love stol'n mine eye, interest dead, now appear, things removed hidden thee lie. Thou art grave buried love doth live, Hung trophies lovers gone, parts thee give, due many, now thine alone. images loved, view thee, thou (all they) hast me. 32 thou survive well-contented day, churl death bones dust shall cover shalt fortune re-survey poor rude lines thy deceased lover: Compare bett'ring time, though outstripped every pen, Reserve love, rhyme, Exceeded height happier men. O vouchsafe loving thought, 'Had friend's Muse grown growing age, dearer birth love brought march ranks better equipage: since died poets better prove, style read, love'. 33 Full many glorious morning seen, Flatter mountain tops sovereign eye, Kissing golden face meadows green; Gilding pale streams heavenly alchemy: Anon permit basest clouds ride, ugly rack celestial face, forlorn world visage hide Stealing unseen west disgrace: Even sun one early morn shine, triumphant splendour brow, alack, one hour mine, region cloud hath masked now. Yet this, love whit disdaineth, Suns world may stain, heaven's sun staineth. 34 didst thou promise beauteous day, make travel forth without cloak, let base clouds o'ertake way, Hiding thy brav'ry rotten smoke? 'Tis enough cloud thou break, dry rain storm-beaten face, man well salve can speak, heals wound, cures disgrace: can thy shame give physic grief, Though thou repent, yet still loss, Th' offender's sorrow lends weak relief bears strong offence's cross. Ah tears pearl thy love sheds, rich, ransom ill deeds. 35 grieved thou hast done, Roses thorns, silver fountains mud, Clouds eclipses stain moon sun, loathsome canker lives sweetest bud. men make faults, even this, Authorizing thy trespass compare, self corrupting salving thy amiss, Excusing thy sins thy sins are: thy sensual fault bring sense, Thy adverse party thy advocate, 'gainst self lawful plea commence: civil war love hate, accessary needs must be, sweet thief sourly robs me. 36 Let confess two must twain, Although undivided loves one: shall blots remain, Without thy help, borne alone. two loves one respect, Though lives separable spite, though alter love's sole effect, Yet doth steal sweet hours love's delight. may evermore acknowledge thee, Lest bewailed guilt thee shame, thou public kindness honour me, Unless thou take honour thy name: so, love thee sort, thou mine, mine thy good report. 37 decrepit father takes delight, see active child deeds youth, I, made lame Fortune's dearest spite Take comfort thy worth truth. whether beauty, birth, wealth, wit, all, all, Entitled thy parts, crowned sit, make love engrafted store: lame, poor, despised, Whilst shadow doth substance give, thy abundance sufficed, part thy glory live: Look best, best wish thee, wish have, ten times happy me. 38 can muse want subject invent thou dost breathe pour'st verse, Thine sweet argument, excellent, every vulgar paper rehearse?

Even this, let us divided live, dear love lose name single one, separation may give: due thee thou deserv'st alone: O absence torment wouldst thou prove, thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, entertain time thoughts love, time thoughts sweetly doth deceive. thou teachest make one twain, praising doth hence remain. 40 Take loves, love, yea take all, hast thou thou hadst before? love, love, thou mayst true love call, mine thine, thou hadst more: love, thou love receivest, blame thee, love thou usest, yet blamed, thou thy self deceivest wilful taste thy self refusest. forgive thy robbery gentle thief Although thou steal thee poverty: yet love knows greater grief bear greater wrong, hate's known injury. Lascivious grace, ill well shows, Kill spites yet must foes. 41 pretty wrongs liberty commits, sometime absent thy heart, Thy beauty, thy years full well befits, still temptation follows thou art. Gentle thou art, therefore won, Beauteous thou art, therefore assailed. woman woos, woman's son, Will sourly leave till prevailed? Ay me, yet thou mightst seat forbear, chide thy beauty, thy straying youth, lead thee riot even thou art forced break twofold truth: thy beauty tempting thee, Thine thy beauty false me. 42 thou hast grief, yet may said loved dearly, hath thee wailing chief, loss love touches nearly.

O excuse will poor beast find, swift extremity can seem slow? spur though mounted wind, winged speed motion shall know, can horse desire keep pace, Therefore desire (of perfect'st love made) Shall neigh (no dull flesh) fiery race, love, love, thus shall excuse jade, Since thee going, went wilful-slow, Towards thee run, give leave go. 52 rich whose blessed key, Can bring sweet up-locked treasure, will every hour survey, blunting fine point seldom pleasure. Therefore feasts solemn rare, Since seldom coming long year set, Like stones worth thinly placed are, captain jewels carcanet. time keeps chest wardrobe robe doth hide, make special instant special-blest, new unfolding imprisoned pride. Blessed whose worthiness gives scope, triumph, lacked hope. 53 substance, whereof made, millions strange shadows tend? Since every one, hath every one, one shade, one, can every shadow lend: Describe Adonis counterfeit, poorly imitated you, Helen's cheek art beauty set, Grecian tires painted new: Speak spring, foison year, one doth shadow beauty show, other bounty doth appear, every blessed shape know. external grace part, like none, none constant heart. 54 O much doth beauty beauteous seem, sweet ornament truth doth give! rose looks fair, fairer deem sweet odour, doth live: canker blooms full deep dye, perfumed tincture roses, Hang thorns, play wantonly, summer's breath masked buds discloses: virtue show, live unwooed, unrespected fade, Die themselves. Sweet roses so, sweet deaths, sweetest odours made: you, beauteous lovely youth, shall fade, verse distills truth. 55 marble, gilded monuments princes shall outlive powerful rhyme, shall shine bright contents unswept stone, besmeared sluttish time. wasteful war shall statues overturn, broils root work masonry, Mars sword, war's quick fire shall burn: living record memory. 'Gainst death, all-oblivious enmity Shall pace forth, praise shall still find room, Even eyes posterity wear world ending doom. till judgment self arise, live this, dwell lovers' eyes. 56 Sweet love renew thy force, said Thy edge blunter appetite, to-day feeding allayed, To-morrow sharpened former might. love thou, although to-day thou fill Thy hungry eyes, even till wink fulness, To-morrow see again, kill spirit love, perpetual dulness: Let sad interim like ocean parts shore, two contracted new, Come daily banks, see: Return love, blest may view. call winter, full care, Makes summer's welcome, thrice wished, rare. 57 slave tend, Upon hours, times desire? precious time spend; services till require. dare chide world-without-end hour, Whilst (my sovereign) watch clock you, think bitterness absence sour, bid servant adieu. dare question jealous thought, may be, affairs suppose, like sad slave stay think nought Save are, happy make those. true fool love, will, (Though thing) thinks ill. 58 god forbid, made first slave, thought control times pleasure, hand th' account hours crave, vassal bound stay leisure. O let suffer (being beck) Th' imprisoned absence liberty, patience tame sufferance bide check, Without accusing injury. list, charter strong, self may privilage time will, doth belong, self pardon self-doing crime. wait, though waiting hell, blame pleasure ill well. 59 nothing new, is, Hath before, brains beguiled, labouring invention bear amis second burthen former child! O record backward look, Even five hundred courses sun, Show image antique book, Since mind first character done. might see old world say, composed wonder frame, Whether mended, whether better they, whether revolution same. O sure wits former days, subjects worse given admiring praise. 60 Like waves make towards pebbled shore, minutes hasten end, changing place goes before, sequent toil forwards contend. Nativity main light, Crawls maturity, wherewith crowned, Crooked eclipses 'gainst glory fight, Time gave, doth now gift confound. Time doth transfix flourish set youth, delves parallels beauty's brow, Feeds rarities nature's truth, nothing stands scythe mow. yet times hope, verse shall stand Praising thy worth, despite cruel hand. 61 thy will, thy image keep open heavy eyelids weary night? Dost thou desire slumbers broken, shadows like thee mock sight? thy spirit thou send'st thee far home deeds pry, find shames idle hours me, scope tenure thy jealousy? O no, thy love though much, great, love keeps mine eye awake, Mine true love doth rest defeat, play watchman ever thy sake. thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere, far off, others near. 62 Sin self-love possesseth mine eye, soul, every part; sin remedy, grounded inward heart. Methinks face gracious mine, shape true, truth account, self mine worth define, other worths surmount. glass shows self indeed beated chopt tanned antiquity, Mine self-love quite contrary read: Self, self-loving iniquity. 'Tis thee (my self) self praise, Painting age beauty thy days. 63 love shall now Time's injurious hand crushed o'erworn, hours drained blood filled brow lines wrinkles, youthful morn Hath travelled age's steepy night, beauties whereof now king vanishing, vanished sight, Stealing away treasure spring: time now fortify confounding age's cruel knife, shall never cut memory sweet love's beauty, though lover's life. beauty shall black lines seen, shall live, still green. 64 seen Time's fell hand defaced rich-proud cost outworn buried age, sometime lofty towers see down-rased, brass eternal slave mortal rage. seen hungry ocean gain Advantage kingdom shore, firm soil win watery main, Increasing store loss, loss store. seen interchange State, state self confounded, decay, Ruin hath taught thus ruminate Time will come take love away. thought death choose weep have, fears lose. 65 Since brass, stone, earth, boundless sea, sad mortality o'ersways power, rage shall beauty hold plea, Whose action stronger flower? O shall summer's honey breath hold out, wrackful siege batt'ring days, rocks impregnable stout, gates steel strong time decays? O fearful meditation, alack, Shall Time's best jewel Time's chest lie hid? strong hand can hold swift foot back, spoil beauty can forbid? O none, unless miracle might, black ink love may still shine bright. 66 Tired restful death cry, behold desert beggar born, needy nothing trimmed jollity, purest faith unhappily forsworn, gilded honour shamefully misplaced, maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, right perfection wrongfully disgraced, strength limping sway disabled art made tongue-tied authority, folly (doctor-like) controlling skill, simple truth miscalled simplicity, captive good attending captain ill. Tired these, gone, Save die, leave love alone. 67 Ah wherefore infection live, presence grace impiety, sin advantage achieve, lace self society? false painting imitate cheek, steal dead seeming living hue? poor beauty indirectly seek, Roses shadow, since rose true? live, now nature bankrupt is, Beggared blood blush lively veins, hath exchequer now his, proud many, lives upon gains? O stores, show wealth had, days long since, last bad. 68 Thus cheek map days outworn, beauty lived died flowers now, bastard signs fair born, durst inhabit living brow: golden tresses dead, right sepulchres, shorn away, live second life second head, Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay: holy antique hours seen, Without ornament, self true, Making summer another's green, Robbing old dress beauty new, map doth Nature store, show false Art beauty yore. 69 parts thee world's eye doth view, Want nothing thought hearts can mend: tongues (the voice souls) give thee due, Uttering bare truth, even foes commend. Thy outward thus outward praise crowned, tongues give thee thine own, other accents praise confound seeing farther eye hath shown. look beauty thy mind, guess measure thy deeds, churls thoughts (although eyes kind) thy fair flower add rank smell weeds: thy odour matcheth thy show, soil this, thou dost common grow. 70 thou art blamed shall thy defect, slander's mark ever yet fair, ornament beauty suspect, crow flies heaven's sweetest air. thou good, slander doth approve, Thy worth greater wooed time, canker vice sweetest buds doth love, thou present'st pure unstained prime. Thou hast passed ambush young days, Either assailed, victor charged, Yet thy praise thy praise, tie envy, evermore enlarged, suspect ill masked thy show, thou alone kingdoms hearts shouldst owe. 71 longer mourn dead, shall hear surly sullen bell Give warning world fled vile world vilest worms dwell: Nay read line, remember not, hand writ it, love so, sweet thoughts forgot, thinking make woe. O (I say) look upon verse, (perhaps) compounded clay, much poor name rehearse; let love even life decay. Lest wise world look moan, mock gone. 72 O lest world task recite, merit lived love death (dear love) forget quite, can nothing worthy prove. Unless devise virtuous lie, mine desert, hang praise upon deceased I, niggard truth willingly impart: O lest true love may seem false this, love speak well untrue, name buried body is, live shame me, you. shamed bring forth, you, love things nothing worth. 73 time year thou mayst behold, yellow leaves, none, few hang Upon boughs shake cold, Bare ruined choirs, late sweet birds sang. thou seest twilight day, sunset fadeth west, black night doth take away, Death's second self seals rest. thou seest glowing fire, ashes youth doth lie, death-bed, whereon must expire, Consumed nourished by. thou perceiv'st, makes thy love strong, love well, thou must leave ere long. 74 contented fell arrest, Without bail shall carry away, life hath line interest, memorial still thee shall stay. thou reviewest this, thou dost review, part consecrate thee, earth can earth, due, spirit thine better part me, thou hast lost dregs life, prey worms, body dead, coward conquest wretch's knife, base thee remembered, worth that, contains, this, thee remains. 75 thoughts food life, sweet-seasoned showers ground; peace hold strife 'twixt miser wealth found. Now proud enjoyer, anon Doubting filching age will steal treasure, Now counting best alone, bettered world may see pleasure, Sometime full feasting sight, clean starved look, Possessing pursuing delight Save had, must took. Thus pine surfeit day day, gluttoning all, away. 76 verse barren new pride? far variation quick change? time glance aside new-found methods, compounds strange? write still one, ever same, keep invention noted weed, every word doth almost tell name, Showing birth, proceed? O know sweet love always write you, love still argument: best dressing old words new, Spending already spent: sun daily new old, love still telling told. 77 Thy glass will show thee thy beauties wear, Thy dial thy precious minutes waste, vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear, book, learning mayst thou taste. wrinkles thy glass will truly show, mouthed graves will give thee memory, Thou thy dial's shady stealth mayst know, Time's thievish progress eternity. Look thy memory contain, Commit waste blanks, thou shalt find children nursed, delivered thy brain, take new acquaintance thy mind. offices, oft thou wilt look, Shall profit thee, much enrich thy book. 78 oft invoked thee muse, found fair assistance verse, every alien pen hath got use, thee poesy disperse. Thine eyes, taught dumb high sing, heavy ignorance aloft fly, added feathers learned's wing, given grace double majesty. Yet proud compile, Whose influence thine, born thee, others' works thou dost mend style, arts thy sweet graces graced be. thou art art, dost advance high learning, rude ignorance. 79 Whilst alone call upon thy aid, verse alone thy gentle grace, now gracious numbers decayed, sick muse doth give other place. grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument Deserves travail worthier pen, Yet thee thy poet doth invent, robs thee of, pays thee again, lends thee virtue, stole word, thy behaviour, beauty doth give found thy cheek: can afford praise thee, thee doth live. thank doth say, Since owes thee, thou thy self dost pay. 80 O faint write, Knowing better spirit doth use name, praise thereof spends might, make tongue-tied speaking fame. since worth (wide ocean is) humble proudest sail doth bear, saucy bark (inferior far his) broad main doth wilfully appear. shallowest help will hold afloat, Whilst upon soundless deep doth ride, (being wrecked) worthless boat, tall building, goodly pride. thrive cast away, worst this, love decay. 81 shall live epitaph make, survive earth rotten, hence memory death take, Although part will forgotten. name hence immortal life shall have, Though (once gone) world must die, earth can yield common grave, entombed men's eyes shall lie, monument shall gentle verse, eyes yet created shall o'er-read, tongues be, shall rehearse, breathers world dead, still shall live (such virtue hath pen) breath breathes, even mouths men. 82 grant thou wert married muse, therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook dedicated words writers use fair subject, blessing every book. Thou art fair knowledge hue, Finding thy worth limit past praise, therefore art enforced seek anew, fresher stamp time-bettering days. love, yet devised, strained touches rhetoric can lend, Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized, true plain words, thy true-telling friend. gross painting might better used, cheeks need blood, thee abused. 83 never saw painting need, therefore fair painting set, found (or thought found) exceed, barren tender poet's debt: therefore slept report, self extant well might show, far modern quill doth come short, Speaking worth, worth doth grow. silence sin impute, shall glory dumb, impair beauty mute, others give life, bring tomb. lives life one fair eyes, poets can praise devise. 84 says most, can say more, rich praise, alone, you? whose confine immured store, example equal grew. Lean penury within pen doth dwell, subject lends small glory, writes you, can tell, you, dignifies story. Let copy writ, making worse nature made clear, counterpart shall fame wit, Making style admired every where. beauteous blessings add curse, fond praise, makes praises worse. 85 tongue-tied muse manners holds still, comments praise richly compiled, Reserve character golden quill, precious phrase Muses filed. think good thoughts, whilst other write good words, like unlettered clerk still cry Amen, every hymn able spirit affords, polished form well refined pen. Hearing praised, say 'tis so, 'tis true, praise add something more, thought, whose love (Though words come hindmost) holds rank before, others, breath words respect, dumb thoughts, speaking effect. 86 proud full sail great verse, Bound prize (all precious) you, ripe thoughts brain inhearse, Making tomb womb wherein grew? spirit, spirits taught write, mortal pitch, struck dead? No, neither he, compeers night Giving aid, verse astonished. affable familiar ghost nightly gulls intelligence, victors silence boast, sick fear thence. countenance filled line, lacked matter, enfeebled mine. 87 Farewell! thou art dear possessing, like enough thou know'st thy estimate, charter thy worth gives thee releasing: bonds thee determinate. hold thee thy granting, riches deserving? cause fair gift wanting, patent back swerving. Thy self thou gav'st, thy worth then knowing, whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking, thy great gift upon misprision growing, Comes home again, better judgement making. Thus thee dream doth flatter, sleep king, waking matter. 88 thou shalt disposed set light, place merit eye scorn, Upon thy side, self fight, prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn: mine weakness best acquainted, Upon thy part can set story faults concealed, wherein attainted: thou losing me, shalt win much glory: will gainer too, bending loving thoughts thee, injuries self do, thee vantage, double-vantage me. love, thee belong, thy right, self will bear wrong. 89 Say thou didst forsake fault, will comment upon offence, Speak lameness, straight will halt: thy reasons making defence. Thou canst (love) disgrace half ill, set form upon desired change, self disgrace, knowing thy will, will acquaintance strangle look strange: absent thy walks tongue, Thy sweet beloved name shall dwell, Lest (too much profane) wronk: haply old acquaintance tell. thee, self vow debate, must ne'er love whom thou dost hate. 90 hate thou wilt, ever, now, Now world bent deeds cross, join spite fortune, make bow, drop after-loss: Ah not, heart hath 'scaped sorrow, Come rearward conquered woe, Give windy night rainy morrow, linger purposed overthrow. thou wilt leave me, leave last, other petty griefs done spite, onset come, shall taste first worst fortune's might. other strains woe, now seem woe, Compared loss thee, will seem so. 91 glory birth, skill, wealth, body's force, garments though new-fangled ill: hawks hounds, horse. every humour hath adjunct pleasure, Wherein finds joy rest, particulars measure, these better one general best. Thy love better high birth me, Richer wealth, prouder garments' costs, delight hawks horses be: having thee, men's pride boast. Wretched alone, thou mayst take, away, wretchcd make. 92 thy worst steal thy self away, term life thou art assured mine, life longer thy love will stay, depends upon love thine. need fear worst wrongs, least life hath end, see, better state belongs that, thy humour doth depend. Thou canst vex inconstant mind, Since life thy revolt doth lie, O happy title find, Happy thy love, happy die! what's blessed-fair fears blot? Thou mayst false, yet know not. 93 shall live, supposing thou art true, Like deceived husband, love's face, May still seem love me, though altered new: Thy looks me, thy heart other place. can live hatred thine eye, Therefore know thy change, many's looks, false heart's history writ moods frowns wrinkles strange. heaven thy creation decree, thy face sweet love ever dwell, Whate'er thy thoughts, thy heart's workings be, Thy looks nothing thence, sweetness tell. like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow, thy sweet virtue answer thy show. 94 power hurt, will none, thing, show, moving others, stone, Unmoved, cold, temptation slow: rightly inherit heaven's graces, husband nature's riches expense, Tibey lords owners faces, Others, stewards excellence: summer's flower summer sweet, Though self, live die, flower base infection meet, basest weed outbraves dignity: sweetest things turn sourest deeds, Lilies fester, smell far worse weeds. 95 sweet lovely dost thou make shame, like canker fragrant rose, Doth spot beauty thy budding name! O sweets dost thou thy sins enclose! tongue tells story thy days, (Making lascivious comments thy sport) dispraise, kind praise, Naming thy name, blesses ill report. O mansion vices got, habitation chose thee, beauty's veil doth cover every blot, things turns fair, eyes can see! Take heed (dear heart) large privilege, hardest knife ill-used doth lose edge. 96 say thy fault youth, wantonness, say thy grace youth gentle sport, grace faults loved less: Thou mak'st faults graces, thee resort: finger throned queen, basest jewel will well esteemed: errors thee seen, truths translated, true things deemed. many lambs might stern wolf betray, like lamb looks translate! many gazers mightst thou lead away, thou wouldst use strength thy state! so, love thee sort, thou mine, mine thy good report. 97 like winter hath absence thee, pleasure fleeting year! freezings felt, dark days seen! old December's bareness everywhere! yet time removed summer's time, teeming autumn big rich increase, Bearing wanton burden prime, Like widowed wombs lords' decease: Yet abundant issue seemed hope orphans, unfathered fruit, summer pleasures wait thee, thou away, birds mute. sing, 'tis dull cheer, leaves look pale, dreading winter's near. 98 absent spring, proud-pied April (dressed trim) Hath put spirit youth every thing: heavy Saturn laughed leaped him. Yet lays birds, sweet smell different flowers odour hue, make any summer's story tell: proud lap pluck grew: wonder lily's white, praise deep vermilion rose, sweet, figures delight: Drawn you, pattern those. Yet seemed winter still, away, shadow these play. 99 forward violet thus chide, Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet smells, love's breath? purple pride thy soft check complexion dwells, love's veins thou hast grossly dyed. lily condemned thy hand, buds marjoram stol'n thy hair, roses fearfully thorns stand, One blushing shame, another white despair: third red, white, stol'n both, robbery annexed thy breath, theft pride growth vengeful canker eat death. flowers noted, yet none see, sweet, colour stol'n thee. 100 art thou Muse thou forget'st long, speak gives thee thy might? Spend'st thou thy fury worthless song, Darkening thy power lend base subjects light? Return forgetful Muse, straight redeem, gentle numbers time idly spent, Sing ear doth thy lays esteem, gives thy pen skill argument. Rise resty Muse, love's sweet face survey, time any wrinkle graven there, any, satire decay, make time's spoils despised everywhere. Give love fame faster Time wastes life, thou prevent'st scythe, crooked knife. 101 O truant Muse shall thy amends, thy neglect truth beauty dyed? truth beauty love depends: dost thou too, therein dignified: Make answer Muse, wilt thou haply say, 'Truth needs colour colour fixed, Beauty pencil, beauty's truth lay: best best, never intermixed'? needs praise, wilt thou dumb? Excuse silence so, for't lies thee, make much outlive gilded tomb: praised ages yet be. thy office Muse, teach thee how, make seem long hence, shows now. 102 love strengthened though weak seeming, love less, though less show appear, love merchandized, whose rich esteeming, owner's tongue doth publish every where. love new, then spring, wont greet lays, Philomel summer's front doth sing, stops pipe growth riper days: summer less pleasant now mournful hymns hush night, wild music burthens every bough, sweets grown common lose dear delight. Therefore like her, sometime hold tongue: dull song. 103 Alack poverty muse brings forth, having scope show pride, argument all bare worth hath added praise beside. O blame can write! Look glass appears face, over-goes blunt invention quite, Dulling lines, disgrace. sinful then striving mend, mar subject well? other pass verses tend, graces gifts tell. more, much verse can sit, glass shows you, look it. 104 fair friend never can old, first eye eyed, seems beauty still: three winters cold, forests shook three summers' pride, Three beauteous springs yellow autumn turned, process seasons seen, Three April perfumes three hot Junes burned, Since first saw fresh yet green. Ah yet doth beauty like dial hand, Steal figure, pace perceived, sweet hue, methinks still doth stand Hath motion, mine eye may deceived. fear which, hear thou age unbred, Ere born beauty's summer dead. 105 Let love called idolatry, beloved idol show, Since all alike songs praises one, one, still such, ever so. Kind love to-day, to-morrow kind, Still constant wondrous excellence, Therefore verse constancy confined, One thing expressing, leaves difference. Fair, kind, true, all argument, Fair, kind, true, varying other words, change invention spent, Three themes one, wondrous scope affords. Fair, kind, true, often lived alone. three till now, never kept seat one. 106 chronicle wasted time, see descriptions fairest wights, beauty making beautiful old rhyme, praise ladies dead, lovely knights, blazon sweet beauty's best, hand, foot, lip, eye, brow, see antique pen expressed, Even beauty master now. all praises prophecies time, all prefiguring, looked divining eyes, skill enough worth sing: now behold these present days, eyes wonder, lack tongues praise. 107 mine fears, prophetic soul, wide world, dreaming things come, Can yet lease true love control, Supposed forfeit confined doom. mortal moon hath eclipse endured, sad augurs mock their presage, Incertainties now crown assured, peace proclaims olives endless age. Now drops balmy time, love looks fresh, death subscribes, Since spite live poor rhyme, insults o'er dull speechless tribes. thou shalt find thy monument, tyrants' crests tombs brass spent. 108 brain ink may character, hath figured thee true spirit, new speak, now register, may express love, thy dear merit? Nothing sweet boy, yet like prayers divine, must each day say o'er same, Counting old thing old, thou mine, thine, Even first hallowed thy fair name. eternal love love's fresh case, Weighs dust injury age, gives necessary wrinkles place, makes antiquity aye page, Finding first conceit love bred, time outward form show dead. 109 O never say false heart, Though absence seemed flame qualify, easy might self depart, soul thy breast doth lie: home love, ranged, Like travels return again, Just time, time exchanged, self bring water stain, Never believe though nature reigned, frailties besiege all kinds blood, preposterously stained, leave nothing all thy sum good: nothing wide universe call, Save thou rose, thou art all. 110 Alas 'tis true, gone there, made self motley view, Gored mine thoughts, sold cheap dear, Made old offences affections new. true is, looked truth Askance strangely: all above, blenches gave heart another youth, worse essays proved thee best love. Now all done, shall end, Mine appetite never will grind newer proof, try older friend, god love, whom confined. give welcome, next heaven best, Even thy pure loving breast. 111 O sake Fortune chide, guilty goddess harmful deeds, better life provide, public means public manners breeds. Thence comes name receives brand, almost thence nature subdued works in, like dyer's hand: Pity then, wish renewed, Whilst like willing patient will drink, Potions eisel 'gainst strong infection, bitterness will bitter think, double penance correct correction. Pity then dear friend, assure ye, Even pity enough cure me. 112 love pity doth th' impression fill, vulgar scandal stamped upon brow, care calls well ill, o'er-green bad, good allow? all world, must strive, know shames praises tongue, None else me, none alive, steeled sense changes right wrong. profound abysm throw all care others' voices, adder's sense, critic flatterer stopped are: Mark neglect dispense. strongly purpose bred, all world besides methinks dead. 113 Since left you, mine eye mind, governs go about, Doth part function, partly blind, Seems seeing, effectually out: form delivers heart bird, flower, shape doth latch, quick objects hath mind part, vision holds doth catch: see rud'st gentlest sight, sweet favour deformed'st creature, mountain, sea, day, night: crow, dove, shapes feature. Incapable more, replete you, true mind thus maketh mine untrue. 114 whether doth mind being crowned Drink monarch's plague flattery? whether shall say mine eye saith true, love taught alchemy? make monsters, things indigest, cherubins sweet self resemble, Creating every bad perfect best fast objects beams assemble: O 'tis first, 'tis flattery seeing, great mind kingly drinks up, Mine eye well knows gust 'greeing, palate doth prepare cup. poisoned, 'tis lesser sin, mine eye loves doth first begin. 115 lines writ lie, Even said love dearer, Yet then judgment knew reason why, full flame afterwards burn clearer, reckoning time, whose millioned accidents Creep 'twixt vows, change decrees kings, Tan sacred beauty, blunt sharp'st intents, Divert strong minds course alt'ring things: Alas fearing time's tyranny, Might then say 'Now love best,' certain o'er incertainty, Crowning present, doubting rest? Love babe, then might say give full growth still doth grow. 116 Let marriage true minds Admit impediments, love love alters alteration finds, bends remover remove. O no, ever-fixed mark looks tempests never shaken; star every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's unknown, although height taken. Love's Time's fool, though rosy lips cheeks Within bending sickle's compass come, Love alters brief hours weeks, bears even edge doom: error upon proved, never writ, man ever loved. 117 Accuse thus, scanted all, Wherein great deserts repay, Forgot upon dearest love call, Whereto all bonds tie day day, frequent unknown minds, given time dear-purchased right, hoisted sail all winds transport farthest sight. Book wilfulness errors down, just proof surmise, accumulate, Bring within level frown, shoot wakened hate: Since appeal says strive prove constancy virtue love. 118 Like make appetite keen eager compounds palate urge, prevent maladies unseen, sicken shun sickness purge. Even being full ne'er-cloying sweetness, bitter sauces did frame feeding; sick welfare found kind meetness, diseased ere true needing. Thus policy love t' anticipate ills not, grew faults assured, brought medicine healthful state rank goodness ill cured. thence learn find lesson true, Drugs poison feil sick you. 119 potions drunk Siren tears Distilled limbecks foul hell within, Applying fears hopes, hopes fears, Still losing saw self win! wretched errors hath heart committed, Whilst hath thought self blessed never! mine eyes their spheres fitted distraction madding fever! O benefit ill, now find true better is, evil still made better. ruined love built anew Grows fairer first, strong, far greater. return rebuked content, gain ills thrice spent. 120 unkind befriends now, sorrow, then did feel, Needs must transgression bow, Unless nerves brass hammered steel. unkindness shaken yours, y'have passed hell time, tyrant leisure taken weigh suffered crime. O night woe might remembered deepest sense, hard true sorrow hits, soon you, then tendered humble salve, wounded bosoms fits! trespass now becomes fee, Mine ransoms yours, yours must ransom me. 121 'Tis better vile vile esteemed, be, receives reproach being, just pleasure lost, deemed, feeling, others' seeing. should others' false adulterate eyes Give salutation sportive blood? frailties frailer spies, their wills count bad think good? No, am, level abuses, reckon their own, may straight though themselves bevel; their rank thoughts, deeds must shown Unless general evil maintain, men bad their badness reign. 122 Thy gift, thy tables, within brain Full charactered lasting memory, shall idle rank remain Beyond all date even eternity. least, long brain heart faculty nature subsist, Till each razed oblivion yield part thee, thy record never can missed: poor retention much hold, need tallies thy dear love score, Therefore give bold, trust those tables receive thee more: keep adjunct remember thee import forgetfulness me. 123 No! Time, thou shalt boast change, Thy pyramids built newer might nothing novel, nothing strange, dressings former sight: dates brief, therefore admire, thou dost foist upon us old, rather make born desire, think heard told: Thy registers thee defy, wond'ring present, past, thy records, see doth lie, Made less thy continual haste: vow shall ever be, will true despite thy scythe thee. 124 dear love child state, might Fortune's bastard unfathered, subject time's love time's hate, Weeds among weeds, flowers flowers gathered. builded far accident, suffers smiling pomp, falls blow thralled discontent, Whereto th' inviting time fashion calls: fears policy heretic, works leases short-numbered hours, all alone stands hugely politic, grows heat, drowns showers. witness call fools time, die goodness, lived crime. 125 Were't aught bore canopy, extern outward honouring, laid great bases eternity, proves short waste ruining? seen dwellers form favour Lose all, paying much rent compound sweet; forgoing simple savour, Pitiful thrivers their gazing spent? No, let obsequious thy heart, take thou oblation, poor free, mixed seconds, knows art, mutual render, thee. Hence, thou suborned informer, true soul impeached, stands least thy control. 126 O thou lovely boy thy power, Dost hold Time's fickle glass fickle hour: hast waning grown, therein show'st, Thy lovers withering, thy sweet self grow'st. Nature (sovereign mistress wrack) thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back, keeps thee this purpose, skill May time disgrace, wretched minutes kill. Yet fear O thou minion pleasure, may detain, still keep treasure! audit (though delayed) answered must be, quietus render thee. 127 old age black counted fair, bore beauty's name: now black beauty's successive heir, beauty slandered bastard shame, since each hand hath put nature's power, Fairing foul art's false borrowed face, Sweet beauty hath name holy bower, profaned, lives disgrace. Therefore mistress' eyes raven black, eyes suited, mourners seem, such born fair beauty lack, Slandering creation false esteem, Yet mourn becoming their woe, every tongue says beauty should look so. 128 oft thou, music, music play'st, Upon blessed wood whose motion sounds thy sweet fingers thou gently sway'st wiry concord mine ear confounds, envy those jacks nimble leap, kiss tender inward thy hand, Whilst poor lips should harvest reap, wood's boldness thee blushing stand. tickled change their state situation those dancing chips, O'er whom thy fingers walk gentle gait, Making dead wood blest living lips, Since saucy jacks happy this, Give thy fingers, thy lips kiss. 129 Th' expense spirit waste shame lust action, till action, lust perjured, murd'rous, bloody full blame, Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, trust, Enjoyed sooner despised straight, Past reason hunted, sooner Past reason hated swallowed bait, purpose laid make taker mad. Mad pursuit possession so, Had, having, quest, extreme, bliss proof proved, woe, joy proposed behind dream. this world well knows yet none knows well, shun heaven leads men this hell. 130 mistress' eyes nothing like sun, Coral far red, lips red, snow white, then breasts dun: hairs wires, black wires grow head: seen roses damasked, red white, such roses see cheeks, perfumes delight, breath mistress reeks. love hear speak, yet well know, music hath far pleasing sound: grant never saw goddess go, mistress walks treads ground. yet heaven think love rare, any belied false compare. 131 Thou art tyrannous, thou art, those whose beauties proudly make cruel; well thou know'st dear doting heart Thou art fairest precious jewel. Yet good faith say thee behold, Thy face hath power make love groan; say err, dare bold, Although swear self alone. sure false swear, thousand groans thinking thy face, One another's neck witness bear Thy black fairest judgment's place. nothing art thou black save thy deeds, thence this slander think proceeds. 132 Thine eyes love, pitying me, Knowing thy heart torment disdain, put black, loving mourners be, Looking pretty ruth upon pain. truly morning sun heaven Better becomes grey cheeks east, full star ushers even Doth half glory sober west those two mourning eyes become thy face: O let then well beseem thy heart mourn since mourning doth thee grace, suit thy pity like every part. will swear beauty black, all foul thy complexion lack. 133 Beshrew heart makes heart groan deep wound gives friend me; Is't enough torture alone, slave slavery sweet'st friend must be? self thy cruel eye hath taken, next self thou harder hast engrossed, him, self, thee am forsaken, torment thrice three-fold thus crossed: Prison heart thy steel bosom's ward, then friend's heart let poor heart bail, Whoe'er keeps me, let heart guard, Thou canst then use rigour gaol. yet thou wilt, being pent thee, Perforce am thine all me. 134 now confessed thine, self am mortgaged thy will, self forfeit, other mine, Thou wilt restore comfort still: thou wilt not, will free, thou art covetous, kind, learned surety-like write me, bond fist doth bind. statute thy beauty thou wilt take, Thou usurer put'st forth all use, sue friend, came debtor sake, lose unkind abuse. lost, thou hast me, pays whole, yet am free. 135 Whoever hath wish, thou hast thy will, 'Will' boot, 'Will' over-plus, enough am vex thee still, thy sweet will making addition thus. Wilt thou whose will large spacious, vouchsafe hide will thine? Shall will others seem right gracious, will fair acceptance shine? sea all water, yet receives rain still, abundance addeth store, thou being rich will add thy will One will mine make thy large will more. Let unkind, fair beseechers kill, Think all one, one 'Will.' 136 thy soul check thee come near, Swear thy blind soul thy 'Will', will thy soul knows admitted there, Thus far love, love-suit sweet fulfil. 'Will', will fulfil treasure thy love, Ay, fill full wills, will one, things great receipt case prove, Among number one reckoned none. number let pass untold, Though thy store's account one must be, nothing hold me, please thee hold, nothing me, something sweet thee. Make name thy love, love still, then thou lov'st name Will. 137 Thou blind fool Love, dost thou mine eyes, behold see see? know beauty is, see lies, Yet best is, take worst be. eyes corrupt over-partial looks, anchored bay all men ride, eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks, Whereto judgment heart tied? should heart think several plot, heart knows wide world's common place? mine eyes seeing this, say this put fair truth upon foul face? things right true heart eyes erred, this false plague now transferred. 138 love swears made truth, believe though know lies, might think untutored youth, Unlearned world's false subtleties. Thus vainly thinking thinks young, Although knows days past best, Simply credit false-speaking tongue, both sides thus simple truth suppressed: wherefore says unjust? wherefore say am old? O love's best habit seeming trust, age love, loves years told. Therefore lie her, me, faults lies flattered be. 139 O call justify wrong, thy unkindness lays upon heart, Wound thine eye thy tongue, Use power power, slay art, Tell thou lov'st elsewhere; sight, Dear heart forbear glance thine eye aside, need'st thou wound cunning thy might more o'erpressed defence can bide? Let excuse thee, ah love well knows, pretty looks mine enemies, therefore face turns foes, elsewhere might dart their injuries: Yet so, since am near slain, Kill outright looks, rid pain. 140 wise thou art cruel, press tongue-tied patience much disdain: Lest sorrow lend words words express, manner pity-wanting pain. might teach thee wit better were, Though love, yet love tell so, testy sick men their deaths near, news health their physicians know. should despair should grow mad, madness might speak ill thee, Now this ill-wresting world grown bad, Mad slanderers mad ears believed be. may so, thou belied, Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide. 141 faith love thee mine eyes, thee thousand errors note, 'tis heart loves despise, despite view pleased dote. mine cars thy tongue's tune delighted, tender feeling base touches prone, taste, smell, desire invited any sensual feast thee alone: five wits, five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart serving thee, leaves unswayed likeness man, Thy proud heart's slave vassal wretch be: plague thus far count gain, makes sin, awards pain. 142 Love sin, thy dear virtue hate, Hate sin, grounded sinful loving, O mine, compare thou thine state, thou shalt find merits reproving, do, those lips thine, profaned their scarlet ornaments, sealed false bonds love oft mine, Robbed others' beds' revenues their rents. lawful love thee thou lov'st those, thine eyes woo mine importune thee, Root pity thy heart grows, Thy pity may deserve pitied be. thou dost seek thou dost hide, self-example mayst thou denied. 143 Lo careful huswife runs catch, One feathered creatures broke away, Sets babe makes all swift dispatch pursuit thing stay: Whilst neglected child holds chase, Cries catch whose busy care bent, follow flies face: prizing poor infant's discontent; run'st thou flies thee, Whilst thy babe chase thee afar behind, thou catch thy hope turn back me: play mother's part, kiss me, kind. will pray thou mayst thy Will, thou turn back loud crying still. 144 Two loves comfort despair, like two spirits suggest still, better angel man right fair: worser spirit woman coloured ill. win soon hell female evil, Tempteth better angel side, corrupt saint devil: Wooing purity foul pride. whether angel turned fiend, Suspect may, yet directly tell, being both both each friend, guess one angel another's hell. Yet this shall ne'er know live doubt, Till bad angel fire good one out. 145 lips Love's hand did make, Breathed forth sound said 'I hate', languished sake: saw woeful state, Straight heart did mercy come, Chiding tongue ever sweet, used giving gentle doom: taught thus anew greet: 'I hate' altered end, followed gentle day, Doth follow night who like fiend heaven hell flown away. 'I hate', hate away threw, saved life saying 'not you'. 146 Poor soul centre sinful earth, sinful earth these rebel powers array, dost thou pine within suffer dearth Painting thy outward walls costly gay? large cost having short lease, Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? Shall worms inheritors this excess Eat thy charge? this thy body's end? soul live thou upon thy servant's loss, let pine aggravate thy store; Buy terms divine selling hours dross; Within fed, without rich more, shall thou feed death, feeds men, death dead, more dying then. 147 love fever longing still, longer nurseth disease, Feeding doth preserve ill, Th' uncertain sickly appetite please: reason physician love, Angry prescriptions kept Hath left me, desperate now approve, Desire death, physic did except. Past cure am, now reason past care, frantic-mad evermore unrest, thoughts discourse mad men's are, random truth vainly expressed. sworn thee fair, thought thee bright, art black hell, dark night. 148 O me! eyes hath love put head, correspondence true sight, have, judgment fled, censures falsely see aright? fair whereon false eyes dote, means world say so? not, then love doth well denote, Love's eye true all men's: no, can it? O can love's eye true, vexed watching tears? marvel then though mistake view, sun self sees not, till heaven clears.
